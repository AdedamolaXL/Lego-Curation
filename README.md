# Lego-Curation
- We expect to be able to access the lego both from the website and from Github. 
- Each lego should have a title and short description on the website. On Github, we could also include the name of the project referenced. 
- Operationally making lego images, pypi packages available and explaining the algorithms the lego implements. 
- Including the github project aupporting the lego if available. 
- Roughly the next step from the landscape and legos docs. Possible to evolve to supporting container images on public Docker or another image repository like artifactory.

## COMPOSABILITY VS COMPATIBILITY

Compatibility refers to the ability of two or more legos to work together without conflicts or issues. It means that the interfaces, data formats, and functionalities of these legos are designed in a way that allows them to interact and exchange information effectively.

Composability, on the other hand, refers to the ability to combine different legos to create new, more complex systems or applications. Composability is about designing protocols or systems in a modular and interoperable way, so that they can be easily combined or composed to achieve desired functionalities or objectives.

In the context of blockchain and decentralized applications, composability is a highly valued characteristic. It allows developers to build on top of existing protocols and smart contracts, leveraging their functionalities and combining them with other protocols or components to create innovative and complex systems.

While compatibility is a prerequisite for composability (protocols need to be compatible to be effectively composed), composability goes beyond compatibility by emphasizing the modularity, interoperability, and ability to create new functionalities through the combination of different protocols or components.

In my course of evaluation, i discovered most of the legos individually did not possess multifactor authentication which is the ability to evaluate more than one factor when evaluating sybil operations. 

Please see my submission here: [ChatGPT vs AntiSybil Legos](https://github.com/AdedamolaXL/ChatGPT-vs-AntiSybil-Legos)

Here is a suitable table evaluating this Legos over various indicators
