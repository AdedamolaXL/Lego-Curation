# Lego-Curation
- We expect to be able to access the lego both from the website and from Github. 
- Each lego should have a title and short description on the website. On Github, we could also include the name of the project referenced. 
- Operationally making lego images available and explaining the algorithms the lego implements. 
- Including the github project aupporting the lego if available. 
- Roughly the next step from the landscape and legos docs. Possible to evolve to supporting container images on public Docker or another image repository like artifactory.
